# In Python, a tuple is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list.
# However, tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.
# They are represented by parentheses () and can contain elements of different data types,
# including numbers, strings, lists, or other tuples.

num = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4,)
